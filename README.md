# 🚀 Iron Ore Procurement Cost Optimization - Predictive Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging **predictive analytics** to optimize **iron ore procurement costs**. Using **machine learning models**, we aim to predict **fluctuations in procurement costs**, enabling businesses to make **data-driven purchasing decisions** and enhance cost efficiency.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Analyze historical **iron ore procurement data**.
- Implement **data preprocessing and feature engineering**.
- Build and evaluate **predictive models**.
- Provide **actionable insights** to reduce procurement costs.
- Develop a **dashboard for visualization** of key trends.

## 🔍 Dataset
We are using a combination of **publicly available and synthetic data** to simulate real-world procurement trends.

### 📂 Data Sources
- Public datasets from **government agencies & industry reports**.
- **Synthetic data** generated based on market trends.
- **Feature selection & engineering** for improved model accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Regression, Time-Series Forecasting, LSTM, Prophet, XGBoost)
- **Power BI / Tableau** (for visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** (development environment)
- **Git & GitHub** (version control & collaboration)

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering & Selection**
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
5. **Result Interpretation & Business Insights**
6. **Dashboard Creation & Deployment**
